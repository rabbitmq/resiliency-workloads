## User Goals

The goal of this workload is to provide guidance to developers on how to write applications that uses
RabbitMQ Java AMQP client which are resilient to connection failures such as:
- when we lose the RabbitMQ node where the application is connected to
- when we shutdown the entire RabbitMQ cluster, e.g. for maintenance reasons
- when we upgrade the RabbitMQ cluster
